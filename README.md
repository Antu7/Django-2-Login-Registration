# Django-2-Login-Registration

##### Before starting Django I was a PHP developer and as PHP developer using Form.py is tough enough for me.So I start searching online Django login registration without using Form.py after searching I found not a good result that's why I decide to create a simple project where I will show full CRUD and also login registration without using Form.py


    python version = 3 >
    virtualenv = 16.0.0 >
