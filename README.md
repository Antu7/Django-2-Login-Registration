# Django-2-Login-Registration

####Before starting Django I was a PHP developer and as PHP developer using Form.py is tough enough for me.
So I start searching online Django login registration without using Form.py after searching 
I found not a good result that's why I decide to create a simple project where I will show full CRUD and also 
login registration without using Form.py


    python version = 3 >
    virtualenv = 16.0.0 >
    MySQL-python = 1.2.5 >
    mysqlclient =1.3.10 >


### Useing packages

    pip install Django = 2 >
    pip install mysqlclient = 1.3.10 >

###  Fllowing steps to run project
##### 1. create a database on mysql
